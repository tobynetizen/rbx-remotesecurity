A showcase of a method of obfuscating remote event traffic bewteen client and server scripts. <br />
Inspired by the "Spread Spectrum" obfuscation technique used by the United States military. <br />

There are two main types of "Spread Spectrum" techniques:
1. **Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS)**: The signal is spread over a wide frequency band by multiplying the data signal with a pseudorandom noise sequence.
2. **Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)**: The signal rapidly changes frequencies according to a pre-determined pattern, making it hard to track.

This method operates similar to the former, but altered to conform to Roblox's system. <br />
